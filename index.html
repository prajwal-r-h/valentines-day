Maybe it's not about a day, maybe its about my entire life and existence, about my every breath and hair, about my soul and heart that is stuck with you in the most beautiful way. But I won't take a step back to make you blush this valentines just because I love you more everyday. Loving you is like breathing.. what keeps me alive effortlessly. I don't need to give it a second thought it's so involuntary. But I wanna keep loving you not untill, but even after my last breath. and make you my valentine for life and after death.</div>
